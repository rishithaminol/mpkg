### Contribution guidelines ###

* You can use your own debugging tools but I recommend
  valgrind and gdb to debug your executable(s).
* To beautify the code you can use uncrustify(The code
  beautifier for C). On some distributions this command does
  not exist. I recommend to use uncrustify.cfg as the default
  uncrustify config because it is a small derivative of
  uncrustify examples with a litle customizations.
* You can download the uncrustify source and compile it yourself.
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncrustify/files/>.
* There are small scripts in the scripts/ directory you can
  use them to manage code yourself.

### Coding style ###
