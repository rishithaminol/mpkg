utils.c
Utility functions useful for the program.

utils.h
Utility macroes and debugging macros (whose job is to
output some information to the developer)

mpkg.c
This is the main source for the programm.

mpkg.h
This header exports the usage output function and program
name to other sections.
temporary file/directory paths used by the programm,
prefix/archive given by the user.

copy.c/copy.h
File and directory copying/removing functions

in_list.c/in_list.h
Used by copy.c to manage inode custom inode table to copy
hard links.

ar.c
Used to manage unix archive formats.
Uses special struct called ar_object. It contains header
table and opened ar file descriptor.
FEATURES
--------
	* search an ar header using a 'char *' type string(ar_search()).
	* extract a file from the ar archive suplying opened fd and header table. (Still experimental).
	* extract all files to the given destination.
	* "extract to memory" using a user defined function (ar_grab()).

ar.h
Contains ar_hdr_ structure implementing an ar header as
a C familiar struct.


info.c
Read info file in the package and converts its contents
to a readable structure in a C programming environment.
The goal of this is,
 * to give the right infomation to a version comparison scheme. (dependancy checker).
 * to store the infomation about a package after installation.
 * to determine architechture with the running system.
 * size of the package.

info.h
contains number of typedef enums and structures.
mav_fld_name - Field names in the format of enum type. This is usefull to hardly use actual field name in string type.
am_binary - Arithmatic binary operators. Store converted string type arithmatic binary operators ("<=", ">=", "=", ...)
mav_dep_type - In the dependancy field there is tokens separated by ','. One of these tokens are separaged from '|'. That is why we use two types of tokens. All of these tokens are represented by this typedef enum type.
struct mav_dep - store dependancy tokens which are more readable by a C program.
mav_fld_type - Field type.
struct info_field - store fields which are more readable by a C program.
