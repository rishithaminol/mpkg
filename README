Contributing
------------
	* You can use your own debugging tools but I recommend
	  valgrind and gdb to debug your executable(s).
	* To beautify the code you can use uncrustify(The code
	  beautifier for C). On some distributions this command does
	  not exist. I recommend to use uncrustify.cfg as the default
	  uncrustify config because it is a small derivative of
	  uncrustify examples with a litle customizations.
	* You can download the uncrustify source and compile it yourself.
	  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncrustify/files/>.
	* There are small scripts in the scripts/ directory you can
	  use them to manage code yourself.
